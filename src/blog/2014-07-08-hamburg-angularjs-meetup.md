Hamburg is the second largest city in Germany, and as such it really should have an **AngularJS Meetup**. It hasn't had one until now, so I founded one.

I did server side development for the most of the last seven months but I finally had a chance to write an internal web application at work using **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)** and I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the process. AngularJS provides you with quite a useful way of structuring an application with services, controllers, directives, centralized configuration and, most importantly, **[dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)** for wiring parts of an application together.

While working on the AngularJS application I noticed that I did not really have enough people to talk to when it came to single-page applications and user experience, so I started to look for a nearby **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)** meetup. 

To my surprise, there was none in Hamburg yet. After all, **[Hamburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg)** is the second largest city in Germany with well over 2 million people if you include the suburbs. I really believe it should have such a meetup so I founded the **[Hamburg AngularJS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-AngularJS-Meetup/)**. Please do join if you agree with me that Hamburg still lacks such a Meetup. 

A first Meetup is scheduled for **Thursday, July 24th, 2014 at 7pm**. There is no venue for the event yet, so please let me know if you would like to sponsor the meetup by providing a location or know anyone who can provide the space. There is also no agenda as of yet. Please let me know if you have anything AngularJS-related that you would like to talk about or that you are particularly interested in.

Cheers,
Matthias
