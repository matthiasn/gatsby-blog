So, I have recently suffered from writer's block. Well no, that's not exactly true. The problem was not getting started with a topic, but rather sticking with it and continuing to work on it. But there may be a way to get back into the rhythm: finish a less complex project.

Looking at my past articles, I seem to have a tendency to go for the long form. While I don’t think there’s anything wrong in that per se, I do want write both long and short articles. Ideally I would have one long article (or three) in the works and at the same time publish short ideas and random ramblings in between. Sometimes with code, sometimes without.

**So here's to a new approach for this blog.** I will still come up with large and (hopefully) profound articles from time to time, so no changes on that front. But in addition, I will also more frequently post shorter notes. Or at least that's the idea. Let's see how it works out.

Regarding the existing newsletter, I am not exactly sure how to leverage that. As a subscriber, you have become accustomed to getting an email once or sometimes twice per month. I don't want to spam you much more frequently all of a sudden. Maybe I should create another newsletter for the more frequent updates? I'm curious about your thoughts on this. For now, I will just announce this change once and then keep using the current newsletter only for the more infrequent long articles only.

Cheers,
Matthias
