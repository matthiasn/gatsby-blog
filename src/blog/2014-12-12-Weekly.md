Last week was great. I had just come back from my trip to the United States the week before, where I attended the **[Conj](http://clojure-conj.org)** and got to hang out with dear friends in both Washington DC and New York City. I used to live in DC in 2009 and 2010, and it was really good to be back. Last Friday, I had a talk at **[Clojure eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1956-clojure-exchange-2014)** in London about my **[BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch)** application and my journey to Clojure. I think there should be a recording somewhere, but I haven’t checked it out just yet. The day before that, I had parted from **[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)** with a **[farewell letter](http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/12/04/Farewell-Scala/)** here on this blog. It took me by surprise how much attention this little letter received [^1], considering that it was really only between Scala and me.

I am glad that relationship is over. Let me just make it clear that I don’t hate Scala. I built some interesting stuff with it in the past. But it is just not as much fun as **[Clojure](http://clojure.org)** is and that’s extremely important to me. I became a programmer after 10 years of project and operations management in healthcare IT [^2], all the while running my own company and managing employees. I did that until it was no longer a challenge. Then I thought, hey, building software myself should be plenty of fun and shouldn’t be all that difficult if done right. But none of the technologies I have worked with so far (C#, Java, JavaScript, Scala) had sparked the excitement that I was looking for. Well, that has definitely changed with Clojure.

I do not have any major new results to report on the **[BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch)** front this week as I was mostly busy with other stuff (such as taxes and actual work). But I did change the design and kicked out **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)** in favor of **[Pure CSS](http://purecss.io)**, which not only looks good by default but is also tiny in comparison to Bootstrap. Here’s a peek of how the new design looks like:

Much better, I find. You can also check out a **[live version](http://birdwatch2.matthiasnehlsen.com/)**. I had really developed a distaste for the old Bootstrap look over the course of the year. Next I want to replace **[D3](http://d3js.org/)**, at least for the bar chart generation. I’d much rather manipulate the **[SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)** in **[ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)** and build the charts myself. Is this going to save me time? Probably not, but this is a toy project, so what does saving time in that context even mean? I am interested in manipulating graphical elements directly from ClojureScript and that’s what matters. I have made good progress so far, but nothing that I’d want to present just yet, maybe next week.

Also, I was able to put some more thought into server-side aggregation. But again, nothing for this week, please check back soon.

Oh, before I forget, I will present at the **[Clojure Meetup in Hamburg](http://www.meetup.com/ClojureUserGroupHH/events/218689956/)** next week on Thursday. Please come and say hi if you're anywhere near Hamburg.

Cheers,
Matthias

[^1]: Thanks to Hacker News, there were like an extra **30K** pageviews on my blog during the first 36 hours after publishing the farewell note. I should publicly part more often, I guess.

[^2]: Okay, I did write some software myself at that time, but my involvement with software development was was mostly overseeing development done by others.
