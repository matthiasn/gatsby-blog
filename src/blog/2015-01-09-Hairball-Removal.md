I’ve been struggling with finishing the next chapter of my **["Building a System in Clojure"](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)** book. I tried to explain and draw the client-side architecture, but instead I’ve been procrastinating [^1] around the conceptual drawings for days and now I realize why. The current architecture of the **[BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch)** web client just plain **sucks**.

<!-- more -->

Which makes me think that procrastination is quite possibly more useful than its grim reputation suggests. Sure, I could have just forced myself to draw the current architecture while oppressing critical thought. The real message, though, was that I had a more than valid reason not to be excited. Anyway, I digress. Yesterday, I finally tried to draw it and the task made me feel uneasy in my stomach. Let’s just say that unsightly hairball had to go.

So instead, I grabbed a **pencil** and carefully drew the blueprint [^2] for the architecture I desire. That’s done; it looks well groomed to me, and I’m excited about the refactoring ahead.

If you are a reader of the book, you can download the current version, see what I mean when I say it’s gruesome and compare that with the redesign when it’s finished. Consider that a feature of becoming a reader early on in the writing process.

That’s it; I’m back to a fun coding session. Thanks for reading.

Happy 2015, 
Matthias

**PS** - you can start reading the book **right away**:

[^1]: I had some fun animating fireworks by manipulating SVG in ClojureScript instead. Maybe I’ll make an article out of that one day.

[^2]: By the way, it was terrific to stow the laptop away safely and use paper and pencil instead. You should give it a try.
