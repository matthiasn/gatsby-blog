Last week, I published the very first version of my **["Building a System in Clojure"](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)** book. I’m thrilled by the amount of interest it has already generated and I’ll do my best to live up to your expectations.

<!-- more -->

Today, after a few hundred readers signed up for free, I have removed the free option. There are more than enough readers now to give valuable feedback on the early versions of the book.
Yesterday and today I have published new versions, with the latest one being roughly 25 pages longer than the initial version. The content is growing fast and a good part of the reason why is that I **really like the authoring process**[^1].

I will publish another version **tomorrow** that aims at covering the entire server-side code in writing and will probably also contain some additional drawings to make things clearer.

So, you will have something to read over the holidays[^2]. Please let me know if any passage needs clarification.

**Thank you** for reading this blog and a **special** thank you if you read my book. I had a plenty of fun this year and I learned a lot. I will take the next week off, so I’ll see you back here in 2015.

Happy Holidays,
Matthias

[^1]: I am using **[leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com)** to publish the book and I love the authoring workflow, it has been nothing but pleasure so far. Writing in Markdown is so much better than constantly having to wrangle with Word files. I will probably write more about that later, but already a **big shout-out to guys at Leanpub** for offering a great service.

[^2]: But only after you spend enough time with your loved ones.
